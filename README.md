# Matrix Display
A little program which displays random characters only the screen in a similar
fashion to the one from the Matrix films.

It's only a simple C# program I quickly wrote in around an hour.

## Displaying Katakana characters
If your console is set to code page 65001 (which you can do by typing
`chcp 65001`), you can see the Japanese symbols instead of the Latin ones.
